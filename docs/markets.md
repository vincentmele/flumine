## Middleware

It is common that you want to carry about analysis on a market before passing through to strategies, similar to Django's middleware design flumine allows middleware to be executed.

For example backtesting uses [simulated middleware](https://github.com/liampauling/flumine/blob/master/flumine/markets/middleware.py#L15) in order to calculate order matching.

!!! note
    Middleware will be executed in the order it is added and before the strategies are processed.

Please see below for the example middleware class if you wish to create your own:

```python
from flumine.markets.middleware import Middleware

class CustomMiddleware(Middleware):
    def __call__(self, market) -> None:
        pass  # called on each MarketBook update

    def add_market(self, market) -> None:
        print("market {0} added".format(market.market_id))

    def remove_market(self, market) -> None:
        print("market {0} removed".format(market.market_id))
```
